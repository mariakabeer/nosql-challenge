# nosql-challenge
For this challenge, I had a lot of difficulty with changing the data types within the first segment of the challenge. I used multiple other resources such as W3, ChatGBT, and other forums but eventually just had to have Gabe take a look at my work. With his help, I figured out the correct code for changing the data types. In the second half of the segment, I also had trouble when trying to query the establishments in London. ChatGBT provided me the corrected version to find the correct number of establishments. For all other questions, I referenced old lectures.
